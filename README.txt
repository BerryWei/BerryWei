I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil Engineering at National Taiwan University, specializing in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to materials science and engineering. My current research focuses on developing deep material networks for homogenization. Broadly, my work aims to bridge the gap between the microstructural characteristics of materials and their macroscopic mechanical properties through the design of innovative computational models.
