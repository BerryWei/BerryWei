I'm a graduate student in the Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) division, Department of Civil Engineering at National Taiwan University. 
My research interest mainly focuses on computational techniques to bridge the relationship between mechanical properties and material microstructure. Also,  I am interested in developing AI-based surrogate models and physics-informed neural networks to accelerate multi-scale modeling for designing materials. 
My research has recently focused on the simulation of acoustic cavitation induced by ultrasonic activation during endodontic therapy.
